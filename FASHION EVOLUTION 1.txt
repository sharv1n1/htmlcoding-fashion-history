        <p>Tall, stiff collars characterized the period, as did women's broad hats and full "Gibson Girl" hairstyles. A new, columnar silhouette introduced by the couturiers of Paris late in the decade signaled the approaching abandonment of the corset as an indispensable garment of fashionable women.</p>

        <p>Dresses took on a whole new dimension. Gone was the corseted waist, and in its place was the hobble skirt that mimicked the "harem" skirts of the Middle East. Paul Poiret, a popular designer of the time, is credited with this fashion movement heavily influenced by Eastern design and colors. Some skirts were so narrow that it was nearly impossible to move. For fear of splitting the skirt, women sometimes wore a length of cord to keep their legs from moving apart too much. It is not clear why they did this.</p>

        <p>When the stock market crashed in 1929, many people were laid off, impacting the purchase of glamorous clothing from the 1920s.  In the 1930s, clothing began to be mended and fixed before new clothing was bought. Furs and fabric flowers were used to fix the hem on a dress. Also, the hemlines were lowered a great deal down to the ankle, unlike in the 1920s when the hemline was at the knee.</p>

        <p>Dresses in the 1940s were not very popular as the war had started. So women wore suits which was worth several dresses of every women that worked in the defense job. But dresses did not fade and after the war became popular. Cocktail dresses were called 'smarter than a day dress but not as formal as a dinner or evening dress'. Evening gowns were either full or tight, and the hem was usually 6-10 inches off the ground.</p>

        <p>1950 fashion was very different from the fashion in 1940 as the style was full skirt, soft shoulders and a tight waist. This was to show off the bust and hourglass figure. This fashion trend had a phrase "make do and mend".</p>
